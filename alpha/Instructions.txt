To play the alpha just run the run-template.bat file

v0.0.1

This has a F*** ton of debug messages and may look very boring when you first open it, dont worry through the only things you have to focus on are:

"Main#main-75: Enter your move:"
"Main#main-76: ROW: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x]"

The first one is your instructions, the second is a cheat sheet to test out the level, the ROW represents what is a valid move or not (0 is reset, 11 is invalid, x is correct)

Commands:

.exit - exits the application without having to solve the puzzle, but solving the puzzle gives you a cool message at the end
